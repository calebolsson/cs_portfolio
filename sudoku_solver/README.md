# Overview

Sudoku is a 9 number puzzle with an astonishing number of possible puzzles. Solving puzzles is an entertaining pastime for many. Since I'm both a puzzle enthusiast as well as an avid programmer, I've decided to combine my interests and attempt to automate the solving of sudoku puzzles using c#. This is done in the purpose of exploration and understanding as I grow my knowledge and practice programming.

This solver will read an input from a file, store the puzzle in its memory, and then display the puzzle. The user will then be able to walk through the steps of solving the puzzle until it is complete (or it gets stuck, which hopefully will only happen when I feed it unsolvable puzzles).

# Development Environment

I'm using Visual Studio to develop the code using only the core C# libraries.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Add more complex processes so that it can beat Expert and above difficulties
- Let the player solve it, and use this code to offer a hint of what to do next
- Allow for more complex puzzles, namely Killer Sudoku that holds extra zone data
- Improve the interface and connect this code to a pretty looking mobile app
